          <h2>Star Wars</h2>
          <p>
             Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film
            series created by George Lucas. The opening crawl is the signature
            device featured in every film of the series. It opens with the static
            blue text, "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....", followed by
            the Star Wars logo and the crawl text, which describes the backstory and
            context of the film. The visuals are accompanied by the "Main Title
            Theme", composed and conducted by John Williams.
          </p>

             The sequence has been featured in every live-action Star Wars film
            produced by Lucasfilm. Although it retains the basic elements, it has
            significantly evolved throughout the series. It is one of the most
            immediately recognizable elements of the franchise and has been
            frequently parodied.

             According to Dennis Muren, who worked on the six films, crawls on the
             original trilogy films were accomplished by filming physical models
             laid out on the floor. The models were approximately 60 cm (2') wide
             and 1.80 m (6') long. The crawl effect was accomplished by the camera
             moving longitudinally along the model. It was difficult and
             time-consuming to achieve a smooth scrolling effect. Furthermore,
             different versions in other languages (such as German, French and
             Spanish) were produced by Industrial Light & Magic.
